## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Embedding & Data Processing

The Embedding and Data Processing system transforms raw text into high-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning. This crucial component serves as the foundation for the RAG engine's ability to understand and compare textual content. The system employs efficient batching strategies, caching mechanisms, and optional dimensionality reduction to balance performance with accuracy. By converting language into mathematical vectors, the system enables similarity comparisons that would be impossible with raw text.

```
Algorithm: EmbeddingGeneration

GenerateEmbeddings(text_chunks, model, batch_size=16, use_cache=true):
  embeddings ← []
  remaining_chunks ← []
  
  // Use cache if enabled
  if use_cache:
    for each chunk in text_chunks:
      cache_key ← Hash(chunk)
      if cache_key in embedding_cache:
        embeddings.append(embedding_cache[cache_key])
      else:
        remaining_chunks.append(chunk)
  else:
    remaining_chunks ← text_chunks
  
  // Process remaining chunks in batches
  for each batch in Batches(remaining_chunks, batch_size):
    batch_embeddings ← model.embed(batch)
    
    // Store in cache and results
    for i from 0 to |batch|-1:
      if use_cache:
        embedding_cache[Hash(batch[i])] ← batch_embeddings[i]
      embeddings.append(batch_embeddings[i])
  
  return embeddings
```

### 2.2 Similarity Search via ANN/HNSW

The Similarity Search system enables efficient retrieval of semantically similar content from potentially millions of vectors. Rather than performing exhaustive comparisons, the system implements Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs to achieve logarithmic-time lookups. This approach creates a multi-layered graph structure where nodes represent vectors and edges connect similar vectors, allowing for rapid traversal to the nearest neighbors of a query vector. The result is a dramatic reduction in search time while maintaining high recall accuracy.

```
Algorithm: HNSWSearch

SearchHNSW(query_vector, index, top_k=5, ef_search=100):
  // Set search parameters
  index.set_ef(ef_search)
  
  // Perform search
  ids, distances ← index.knn_query(query_vector, k=top_k)
  
  // Convert distances to similarities
  similarities ← [1 - distance for distance in distances]
  
  // Create result objects
  results ← []
  for i from 0 to |ids|-1:
    results.append({id: ids[i], similarity: similarities[i]})
  
  // Sort by similarity
  Sort results by similarity (descending)
  
  return results
```

### 2.2.1 Vector Operations

The Vector Operations subsystem implements fundamental mathematical functions for working with embeddings. These operations form the mathematical foundation for all similarity calculations and vector manipulations throughout the system. Efficient implementations of these operations are critical for system performance, as they are executed millions of times during normal operation. The system includes specialized functions for vector normalization, similarity calculation, and batch processing to maximize computational efficiency.

```
Algorithm: VectorOperations

NormalizeVector(vector):
  norm ← SquareRoot(Sum(vector[i]² for all i))
  if norm > 0:
    return [vector[i]/norm for all i]
  return vector  // Zero vector

CosineSimilarity(vector1, vector2):
  v1 ← NormalizeVector(vector1)
  v2 ← NormalizeVector(vector2)
  return Sum(v1[i] × v2[i] for all i)

BatchSimilarity(query_vector, candidate_vectors):
  norm_query ← NormalizeVector(query_vector)
  similarities ← []
  
  for each candidate in candidate_vectors:
    norm_candidate ← NormalizeVector(candidate)
    similarity ← Sum(norm_query[i] × norm_candidate[i] for all i)
    similarities.append(similarity)
  
  return similarities
```

### 2.2.2 PCA-Based Indexing Optimization

The PCA-Based Indexing Optimization system enhances search performance by reducing the dimensionality of embedding vectors while preserving their semantic relationships. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identifies the most informative dimensions in the embedding space, allowing the system to represent vectors with fewer dimensions while retaining most of their semantic information. This optimization creates a two-tier search architecture where initial candidate selection uses reduced vectors for speed, followed by precise re-ranking with full vectors for accuracy.

```
Algorithm: PCAIndexOptimization

OptimizePCAIndex(embeddings, target_dimensions=128, variance_threshold=0.9):
  // Compute PCA
  pca_model ← FitPCA(embeddings, n_components=target_dimensions)
  
  // Check explained variance
  variance_ratio ← pca_model.explained_variance_ratio
  cumulative_variance ← Sum(variance_ratio)
  
  // Adjust dimensions if needed
  if cumulative_variance < variance_threshold:
    target_dimensions ← FindMinDimensionsForVariance(variance_ratio, variance_threshold)
    pca_model ← FitPCA(embeddings, n_components=target_dimensions)
  
  // Transform embeddings to reduced space
  reduced_embeddings ← pca_model.transform(embeddings)
  
  return {
    pca_model,
    reduced_embeddings,
    variance_preserved: cumulative_variance,
    dimensions: target_dimensions
  }
```

### 2.3 Recursive Agent Operations

The Recursive Agent Operations system orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents that continuously refine and enhance the knowledge base. Each agent performs specific tasks such as expanding content with additional context, merging related information, splitting mixed content, or pruning irrelevant details. The system coordinates these agents based on the current cognitive state, prioritizing operations according to available energy and system needs. This creates a self-improving knowledge ecosystem that becomes more valuable over time.

```
Algorithm: AgentCoordinator

CoordinateAgents(cognitive_system, document_store, agents):
  // Get system state
  system_state ← cognitive_system.GetSystemState()
  energy_level ← cognitive_system.GetEnergyLevel()
  optimization_level ← cognitive_system.GetOptimizationLevel()
  
  // Prioritize agents based on state
  agent_queue ← PrioritizeAgentsByState(agents, system_state)
  
  // Execute with energy awareness
  results ← []
  for each agent in agent_queue:
    // Check energy requirements
    required_energy ← agent.GetEnergyRequirement()
    if energy_level < required_energy and agent.priority ≠ "critical":
      DeferAgentOperation(agent)
      continue
    
    // Execute agent
    agent.SetOptimizationLevel(optimization_level)
    cognitive_system.RecordOperationStart(agent.type)
    agent_result ← agent.Execute(document_store)
    cognitive_system.RecordOperationComplete(agent.type)
    
    results.append(agent_result)
  
  return results
```

#### 2.4.1 Vector Database System

The Vector Database system provides specialized storage and retrieval capabilities for embedding vectors and their associated content. Unlike traditional databases, the Vector Database is optimized for similarity-based operations rather than exact matching. It implements a two-tier architecture with fast approximate search followed by precise reranking, along with support for metadata filtering, chunking, and deduplication. This specialized storage layer is critical for efficient RAG operations, as it enables rapid content retrieval based on semantic similarity.

```
Algorithm: VectorDatabaseSystem

AddDocument(doc_id, chunks, embeddings, metadata):
  for i from 0 to |chunks|-1:
    chunk_id ← GenerateChunkID(doc_id, i)
    
    // Check for duplicates
    if EnableDeduplication and IsNearDuplicate(embeddings[i]):
      continue
    
    // Add to storage
    storage.Add({
      "doc_id": doc_id,
      "chunk_id": chunk_id,
      "text": chunks[i],
      "embedding": embeddings[i],
      "metadata": metadata,
      "timestamp": current_time()
    })
    
    // Add to search index
    search_index.Add(chunk_id, embeddings[i])
  
  UpdateDatabaseStatistics()
  
  return {
    "doc_id": doc_id,
    "chunks_added": |chunks|,
    "total_chunks": GetTotalChunks()
  }

Search(query_embedding, top_k=5, threshold=0.6, filters=null):
  // First pass - use fast index
  candidates ← search_index.Search(query_embedding, k=top_k*2)
  
  // Apply filtering
  if filters:
    candidates ← ApplyFilters(candidates, filters)
  
  // Second pass - re-rank with full vectors
  results ← []
  for each candidate in candidates:
    full_vector ← storage.GetEmbedding(candidate.id)
    similarity ← CosineSimilarity(query_embedding, full_vector)
    
    if similarity ≥ threshold:
      chunk ← storage.GetChunk(candidate.id)
      results.append({
        "chunk_id": candidate.id,
        "doc_id": chunk.doc_id,
        "text": chunk.text,
        "similarity": similarity,
        "metadata": chunk.metadata
      })
  
  // Sort and return top results
  Sort results by similarity (descending)
  return first top_k items from results
```

### 2.5 API & Concurrency

The API & Concurrency system provides external access to the RAG engine's capabilities through well-defined interfaces while managing concurrent requests efficiently. It implements a RESTful API for document management, querying, and system statistics, along with WebSocket connections for real-time monitoring. The system handles multiple simultaneous requests through a combination of thread pooling, asynchronous processing, and prioritization mechanisms. This approach ensures responsive performance even under high load while preventing resource contention.

```
Algorithm: APILayer

// Core API endpoints
Endpoints:
  POST /documents/add:
    // Add document to knowledge base
    Input: {document_text, metadata, chunking_strategy}
    Output: {document_id, chunks_processed, status}
  
  POST /query:
    // Perform RAG query
    Input: {query_text, top_k, threshold, filters, include_citations}
    Output: {answers, context_chunks, citations, metadata}
  
  GET /documents/{doc_id}:
    // Retrieve document
    Output: {document_text, metadata, chunks, statistics}
  
  DELETE /documents/{doc_id}:
    // Remove document
    Output: {status, chunks_removed}
  
  GET /system/stats:
    // Get system statistics
    Output: {document_count, chunk_count, embedding_stats, memory_usage}
  
  WS /system/monitor:
    // Real-time monitoring
    Events: {system_state_updates, query_processing, cognitive_state}
```

### 2.6 Visualization Module

The Visualization Module provides interactive graphical representations of the system's knowledge structures and operations. It renders complex graph data in an intuitive interface where users can explore relationships between concepts, observe clustering patterns, and track how queries traverse the knowledge base. The system supports zooming, panning, node selection, and highlighting of related content. This visual layer makes the abstract knowledge structures tangible and provides insights into the system's reasoning process that would be difficult to gain from text alone.

```
Algorithm: GraphVisualizer

Initialize(config):
  width ← config.width or 1200
  height ← config.height or 800
  scale ← 1.0
  offset_x, offset_y ← 0, 0
  node_positions ← {}
  selected_node ← null
  highlight_paths ← []
  view_mode ← "combined"
  
  // Initialize backend
  if config.backend = "pygame": InitializePygameBackend()
  else if config.backend = "web": InitializeWebBackend()
  else: InitializeDefaultBackend()

RenderGraph(graph_data):
  // Calculate positions if needed
  if node_positions is empty:
    node_positions ← CalculateForceDirectedLayout(graph_data)
  
  // Draw edges
  for each edge in graph_data.edges:
    source_pos ← TransformToViewport(node_positions[edge.source_id])
    target_pos ← TransformToViewport(node_positions[edge.target_id])
    
    edge_color ← GetEdgeColor(edge)
    edge_width ← GetEdgeWidth(edge)
    
    if edge in highlight_paths:
      edge_color ← HIGHLIGHT_COLOR
      edge_width ← edge_width * 2
    
    DrawLine(source_pos, target_pos, edge_color, edge_width)
  
  // Draw nodes
  for each node in graph_data.nodes:
    pos ← TransformToViewport(node_positions[node.id])
    node_color ← GetNodeColor(node)
    node_size ← GetNodeSize(node)
    
    if node.id = selected_node:
      node_color ← SELECTED_COLOR
      node_size ← node_size * 1.2
    else if NodeInHighlightedPath(node.id):
      node_color ← HIGHLIGHT_COLOR
    
    DrawNode(pos, node_size, node_color)
    
    // Draw labels if zoomed in enough
    if scale > 0.7:
      DrawNodeLabel(pos, node.label or node.id, GetLabelColor(node))
  
  // Draw UI elements and update screen
  DrawUserInterface()
  UpdateDisplay()

HandleInteraction(event):
  if event.type = MOUSE_CLICK:
    clicked_node ← FindNodeAtPosition(event.position)
    if clicked_node: SelectNode(clicked_node)
    else: ClearSelection()
  
  else if event.type = MOUSE_DRAG:
    if event.button = LEFT:  // Pan view
      offset_x += event.delta_x
      offset_y += event.delta_y
    else if event.button = RIGHT and selected_node:  // Move node
      node_positions[selected_node] ← ScreenToGraphCoordinates(event.position)
  
  else if event.type = MOUSE_WHEEL:  // Zoom
    old_scale ← scale
    scale ← Clamp(scale * (1 + event.delta * 0.1), 0.1, 5.0)
    
    // Zoom toward mouse position
    scale_factor ← scale / old_scale
    offset_x ← event.position.x - (event.position.x - offset_x) * scale_factor
    offset_y ← event.position.y - (event.position.y - offset_y) * scale_factor
```

### 2.7 Resource Collection System

The Resource Collection System manages the acquisition and preprocessing of content from various sources. It employs specialized extractors for different source types (web pages, files, databases, APIs) and parsers for different content formats (plain text, HTML, PDF, JSON, markdown). The system operates in a parallel, queue-based architecture that can process content asynchronously while respecting rate limits and source constraints. This modular approach allows the system to ingest content from virtually any source while abstracting away the complexity of different formats and access methods.

```
Algorithm: ResourceCollector

Initialize(config):
  // Setup processing pool
  max_workers ← config.max_workers or 4
  processing_thread_pool ← new ThreadPool(max_workers)
  
  // Register extractors and parsers
  RegisterExtractor("web", WebExtractor)
  RegisterExtractor("file", FileSystemExtractor)
  RegisterExtractor("database", DatabaseExtractor)
  RegisterExtractor("api", APIExtractor)
  
  RegisterParser("text/plain", TextParser)
  RegisterParser("text/html", HTMLParser)
  RegisterParser("application/pdf", PDFParser)
  RegisterParser("application/json", JSONParser)
  RegisterParser("text/markdown", MarkdownParser)
  
  // Initialize processing queue
  document_queue ← new ThreadSafeQueue()
  processed_documents ← new ConcurrentSet()
  
  // Start background processing if configured
  if config.auto_process:
    StartBackgroundProcessing()

CollectFromSource(source):
  // Get appropriate extractor
  source_type ← DetectSourceType(source)
  extractor ← extractor_registry[source_type]
  
  if not extractor:
    throw Exception("Unsupported source type: " + source_type)
  
  // Apply rate limiting if needed
  if source.domain in rate_limiters:
    rate_limiters[source.domain].Acquire()
  
  // Extract and queue documents
  raw_documents ← extractor.Extract(source)
  
  for each doc in raw_documents:
    if doc.id not in processed_documents:
      document_queue.Enqueue(doc)
      processed_documents.Add(doc.id)
  
  return {
    queued_documents: |raw_documents|,
    source_type: source_type
  }

ProcessDocument(raw_document):
  // Parse document
  content_type ← DetectContentType(raw_document)
  parser ← parser_registry[content_type]
  
  if not parser:
    Log warning("No parser for content type: " + content_type)
    return null
  
  // Process document
  parsed_document ← parser.Parse(raw_document)
  metadata ← ExtractMetadata(parsed_document)
  normalized_text ← NormalizeText(parsed_document.text)
  
  return {
    id: raw_document.id,
    text: normalized_text,
    metadata: metadata,
    content_type: content_type,
    source: raw_document.source,
    timestamp: current_time()
  }
```

### 2.8 Performance Monitoring

The Performance Monitoring system tracks key metrics across all components to ensure optimal operation and identify bottlenecks. It collects data on system-level resources (CPU, memory, disk, network) as well as component-specific metrics (query latency, cache hit rates, embedding generation time). The collected metrics are stored in a time-series database for historical analysis and visualized through dashboards. The system also implements alerting based on configurable thresholds to proactively identify performance issues before they impact users.

```
Algorithm: PerformanceMonitor

Initialize(config, components):
  // Setup monitoring config
  collection_interval ← config.interval or 60
  retention_period ← config.retention_period or 604800  // 7 days
  alert_thresholds ← config.thresholds or DefaultThresholds()
  
  // Initialize storage
  metrics_store ← new TimeSeriesDatabase(config.storage_path, retention_period)
  
  // Register metrics and hooks
  RegisterSystemMetrics()
  RegisterComponentMetrics(components)
  
  for each component in components:
    InstallMonitoringHooks(component.name, component)
  
  // Start collection if configured
  if config.auto_collect:
    StartMetricsCollection()

CollectMetricsLoop():
  while not shutdown_requested:
    // Collect metrics
    metrics_batch ← CollectMetrics()
    
    // Store metrics
    metrics_store.Store(metrics_batch)
    
    // Check for alerts
    alerts ← CheckAlertConditions(metrics_batch)
    if alerts:
      EmitAlerts(alerts)
    
    // Sleep until next interval
    elapsed ← current_time() - collection_start
    sleep_time ← max(0, collection_interval - elapsed)
    Sleep(sleep_time)

CollectMetrics():
  timestamp ← current_time()
  metrics ← {}
  
  // System metrics
  metrics["system"] ← {
    cpu_percent: GetCPUUsage(),
    memory_used: GetMemoryUsage(),
    disk_io: GetDiskIO(),
    network_io: GetNetworkIO(),
    thread_count: GetThreadCount()
  }
  
  // Component metrics
  for each component_name, hooks in component_hooks:
    component_metrics ← {}
    
    for each metric_name, collector_func in hooks:
      try:
        metric_value ← collector_func()
        component_metrics[metric_name] ← metric_value
      catch Exception as e:
        Log error("Error collecting " + component_name + "." + metric_name)
    
    metrics[component_name] ← component_metrics
  
  return {timestamp, metrics}
```

### 2.9 Multi-Level Caching System

The Multi-Level Caching System optimizes data access patterns through a hierarchical caching architecture. It implements multiple cache tiers (memory, disk, distributed) with different performance characteristics and capacities, automatically promoting frequently accessed data to faster tiers. The system employs intelligent eviction policies based on usage patterns and configurable TTL values for different data types. This layered approach dramatically reduces computation and database access by storing calculated results at optimal cache levels, significantly improving overall system responsiveness.

```
Algorithm: MultiLevelCache

Initialize(config):
  // Configure cache levels
  for each level_config in config.levels:
    level_name ← level_config.name
    level_type ← level_config.type
    
    // Create appropriate implementation
    if level_type = "memory": cache_levels[level_name] ← new MemoryCache(level_config)
    else if level_type = "disk": cache_levels[level_name] ← new DiskCache(level_config)
    else if level_type = "redis": cache_levels[level_name] ← new RedisCache(level_config)
    
    // Store configuration
    default_ttl[level_name] ← level_config.ttl
    max_size[level_name] ← level_config.max_size
    eviction_policy[level_name] ← level_config.eviction_policy

Get(key, context=null):
  // Try each cache level in order
  for each level_name in cache_levels:
    cache_result ← cache_levels[level_name].Get(key)
    
    if cache_result:
      // Record hit and promote to higher levels
      metrics.RecordHit(level_name, context)
      PromoteToHigherLevels(key, cache_result, level_name)
      return cache_result
  
  // Record miss
  metrics.RecordMiss(context)
  return null

Set(key, value, ttl=null, levels=null):
  // Set in specified or all levels
  target_levels ← levels or keys(cache_levels)
  
  for each level_name in target_levels:
    if level_name in cache_levels:
      level_ttl ← ttl or default_ttl[level_name]
      cache_levels[level_name].Set(key, value, level_ttl)
  
  return true
```

### 2.10 Design Patterns

The Singleton Pattern ensures that classes with global access requirements are instantiated only once throughout the application lifecycle. This pattern is crucial for components that manage shared resources, maintain global state, or provide centralized coordination. The implementation uses thread-safe double-checking to prevent race conditions in concurrent environments. By restricting instantiation, the Singleton pattern prevents resource conflicts, reduces memory usage, and ensures consistent system behavior.

```
Algorithm: Singleton

// Static instance variable
static instance ← null

// Get instance method
GetInstance():
  if instance is null:
    // Use double-checking lock pattern
    Acquire lock
    if instance is still null:
      instance ← new Singleton()
    Release lock
  
  return instance
```

#### 2.10.2 Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern provides a flexible mechanism for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. It implements a registration system where creator functions are mapped to type identifiers, allowing new types to be added without modifying existing code. This pattern is essential for the system's extensibility, as it enables the addition of new agent types, parsers, extractors, and other components through configuration rather than code changes. The factory approach decouples object creation from usage, promoting modular design and testability.

```
Algorithm: Factory

// Registry of creators
registry ← empty Dictionary

Register(type_id, creator_function):
  registry[type_id] ← creator_function

Create(type_id, parameters):
  if type_id not in registry:
    throw Exception("Unknown type: " + type_id)
  
  creator ← registry[type_id]
  return creator(parameters)
```

### 2.11 Agentic Framework

The Agentic Framework provides the foundation for autonomous, specialized components that perform specific tasks within the RAG system. Each agent implements a common interface while specializing in particular operations such as content expansion, merging, splitting, or pruning. The framework includes energy awareness, where agents adapt their behavior based on available computational resources, and prioritization mechanisms to ensure critical operations are performed even in resource-constrained states. This design enables the system to continuously improve its knowledge base through coordinated agent operations.

```
Algorithm: BaseAgent

// Base properties
agent_type      // Type identifier
priority        // Priority level
energy_cost     // Energy consumption

Execute(context):
  // Abstract method to be implemented by specific agents
  NotImplementedError()

GetEnergyRequirement():
  return energy_cost

SetOptimizationLevel(level):
  // Adjust agent behavior based on optimization level
  if level = 0:  // No optimization
    // Use full capabilities
  else if level ≥ 3:  // High optimization
    // Use minimal operation
```

```
Algorithm: AgentCollaboration

OrchestrateAgents(agents, cognitive_system, context):
  // Get system state
  state ← cognitive_system.GetSystemState()
  energy ← cognitive_system.GetEnergyLevel()
  sleep_stage ← cognitive_system.GetSleepStage()
  
  // Determine execution strategy
  if sleep_stage ≠ "AWAKE":
    selected_agents ← FilterMaintenanceAgents(agents)
  else if state = "PROTECTIVE":
    selected_agents ← FilterCriticalAgents(agents)
  else:
    selected_agents ← PrioritizeAgentsByState(agents, state)
  
  // Execute agents with energy awareness
  result ← context
  for each agent in selected_agents:
    if agent.GetEnergyRequirement() ≤ energy or agent.priority = "critical":
      cognitive_system.RecordOperationStart(agent.type)
      result ← agent.Execute(result)
      cognitive_system.RecordOperationComplete(agent.type)
  
  return result
```

### 2.12 Data Acquisition System

The Data Acquisition System manages the process of collecting, extracting, and normalizing content from diverse sources. It implements a configurable pipeline architecture where each stage performs specific transformations such as text normalization, metadata extraction, chunking, and entity recognition. The system includes specialized components for web crawling with respect for robots.txt and rate limits, and multimodal processing to handle images, audio, video, and structured data. This comprehensive approach enables the RAG system to ingest knowledge from virtually any source in a controlled, efficient manner.

```
Algorithm: ProcessingPipeline

Initialize(config):
  // Configure pipeline
  for each stage_config in config.stages:
    processor ← CreateProcessor(stage_config.type, stage_config.config)
    processors[stage_config.name] ← processor
    stages.append(stage_config.name)

ProcessDocument(document):
  current_doc ← document
  stage_results ← {}
  
  // Process through each stage
  for each stage_name in stages:
    processor ← processors[stage_name]
    
    try:
      start_time ← current_time()
      result ← processor.Process(current_doc)
      current_doc ← result.document
      stage_results[stage_name] ← result.metadata
      
      // Record metrics
      elapsed ← current_time() - start_time
      metrics.RecordStageTime(stage_name, elapsed)
    catch Exception as e:
      metrics.RecordError(stage_name, e)
      return {
        success: false,
        error: e.message,
        stage: stage_name,
        partial_results: stage_results
      }
  
  return {
    success: true,
    document: current_doc,
    stage_results: stage_results
  }
```

```
Algorithm: WebCrawler

Initialize(config):
  // Configure crawler
  politeness_delay ← config.politeness_delay or 2.0
  max_urls_per_domain ← config.max_urls_per_domain or 100
  max_depth ← config.max_depth or 3
  respect_robots ← config.respect_robots or true
  
  // Initialize data structures
  urls_queue ← new PriorityQueue()
  visited_urls ← new Set()
  url_fingerprints ← {}
  robots_cache ← {}

EnqueueURL(url, depth, source):
  // Don't exceed max depth
  if depth > max_depth: return false
  
  // Skip if already visited
  normalized_url ← NormalizeURL(url)
  if normalized_url in visited_urls: return false
  
  // Check domain limits
  domain ← ExtractDomain(normalized_url)
  if domain_url_counts[domain] ≥ max_urls_per_domain: return false
  
  // Check robots.txt
  if respect_robots and not IsAllowedByRobots(normalized_url): return false
  
  // Add to queue
  job ← {url: normalized_url, depth, priority: CalculatePriority(url, depth, source)}
  urls_queue.Enqueue(job, job.priority)
  
  return true

CrawlNext():
  // Get next URL
  if urls_queue.IsEmpty(): return null
  
  job ← urls_queue.Dequeue()
  url ← job.url
  
  // Mark as visited and apply rate limiting
  visited_urls.Add(url)
  domain ← ExtractDomain(url)
  rate_limiters[domain].Acquire()
  
  // Fetch content
  fetch_result ← FetchURL(url)
  if not fetch_result.success: return {success: false, error: fetch_result.error}
  
  // Check for content change
  content_hash ← CalculateHash(fetch_result.content)
  if url in url_fingerprints and content_hash = url_fingerprints[url]:
    return {success: true, changed: false}
  
  url_fingerprints[url] ← content_hash
  
  // Extract content and links
  content ← ExtractContent(url, fetch_result.content)
  links ← ExtractLinks(url, fetch_result.content)
  
  // Enqueue links
  for each link in links:
    EnqueueURL(link, job.depth + 1, url)
  
  return {
    success: true,
    changed: true,
    content: content,
    links_found: |links|
  }
```

```
Algorithm: MultimodalHandler

Initialize(config):
  // Register content processors
  RegisterProcessor("image/*", ImageProcessor)
  RegisterProcessor("audio/*", AudioProcessor)
  RegisterProcessor("video/*", VideoProcessor)
  RegisterProcessor("application/pdf", PDFProcessor)
  RegisterProcessor("text/html", HTMLProcessor)

ProcessContent(content, content_type):
  // Find appropriate processor
  processor ← FindMatchingProcessor(content_type)
  
  if not processor:
    throw Exception("No processor for content type: " + content_type)
  
  // Process the content
  result ← processor.Process(content, config)
  
  return {
    text: result.text,
    metadata: result.metadata,
    confidence: result.confidence
  }
```

### 2.13 Cognitive System Integration (CRAG)

The Cognitive System Integration (CRAG) embeds biologically-inspired self-regulation mechanisms into the RAG architecture. It implements energy and entropy tracking to model computational resource availability, sleep cycles for system maintenance and optimization, and a dual-graph memory architecture that combines associative and structured knowledge representation. This biomimetic approach enables the system to adapt to varying workloads, prioritize operations based on resource availability, and continuously optimize its knowledge structures through scheduled maintenance periods.

```
Algorithm: CognitiveIntegration

IntegrateCognitiveFunctions(rag_engine, cognitive_system):
  // 1. Connect operation tracking
  rag_engine.SetOperationTracker(cognitive_system.RecordOperation)
  
  // 2. Add state-based parameter adaptation
  rag_engine.SetParameterAdjuster(cognitive_system.AdjustParameterForState)
  
  // 3. Integrate memory structures with vector database
  vector_db ← rag_engine.GetVectorDatabase()
  memory_graph ← cognitive_system.GetMemoryGraph()
  experience_graph ← cognitive_system.GetExperienceGraph()
  
  ConnectVectorDBWithMemoryGraphs(vector_db, memory_graph, experience_graph)
  
  // 4. Setup sleep cycle maintenance operations
  maintenance_manager ← rag_engine.GetMaintenanceManager()
  cognitive_system.RegisterMaintenanceOperations(maintenance_manager.GetOperations())
  
  // 5. Add cognitive API endpoints
  api_server ← rag_engine.GetAPIServer()
  cognitive_api ← cognitive_system.GetAPIEndpoints()
  api_server.RegisterEndpoints(cognitive_api)
  
  return {status: "integrated", components: [
    "energy_tracking", "entropy_management", 
    "sleep_cycles", "memory_graph", "experience_graph"
  ]}
```

##### 2.13.3.1 Memory Graph

The Memory Graph provides structured knowledge representation through a semantic network of entities and typed relationships. Unlike vector embeddings that capture similarity through proximity in vector space, the Memory Graph explicitly models knowledge as triples (subject-predicate-object) with defined relationship types. It supports operations such as entity and relationship management, path-based querying, and logical inference. This explicit representation enables precise factual recall, ontological reasoning, and structured knowledge extraction that complements the pattern-matching strengths of vector embeddings.

```
Algorithm: MemoryGraph

Initialize(ontology_schema, relation_types):
  // Core storage structures
  entities ← {}
  relationships ← {}
  
  // Index structures
  entity_type_index ← {}
  relationship_type_index ← {}
  
  // Load schemas
  if ontology_schema: LoadOntologySchema(ontology_schema)
  if relation_types: LoadRelationTypes(relation_types)
  else:
    // Default relation types
    relation_types ← {
      "is_a": {transitive: true, symmetric: false, inverse: "has_instance"},
      "has_part": {transitive: true, symmetric: false, inverse: "part_of"},
      "related_to": {transitive: false, symmetric: true, inverse: "related_to"}
      // ...other default relations...
    }

AddEntity(type, name, properties):
  entity_id ← GenerateEntityID(type, name)
  
  if entity_id in entities:
    return {success: false, message: "Entity already exists"}
  
  // Create entity node
  entity ← {
    id: entity_id,
    type: type,
    name: name,
    properties: {},
    created_at: current_time()
  }
  
  // Add to storage and indices
  entities[entity_id] ← entity
  if type not in entity_type_index:
    entity_type_index[type] ← {}
  entity_type_index[type].Add(entity_id)
  
  // Add properties
  if properties:
    for each property_name, value in properties:
      property_id ← AddProperty(entity_id, property_name, value)
      entity.properties[property_name] ← property_id
  
  return {success: true, entity_id}

AddRelationship(source_id, relation_type, target_id, weight=1.0):
  // Validate inputs
  if source_id not in entities or target_id not in entities:
    return {success: false, message: "Entity not found"}
  
  if relation_type not in relation_types:
    return {success: false, message: "Unknown relation type"}
  
  // Create relationship
  relationship_id ← GenerateRelationshipID(source_id, relation_type, target_id)
  
  if relationship_id in relationships:
    return {success: false, message: "Relationship already exists"}
  
  // Store relationship
  relationship ← {
    id: relationship_id,
    source_id: source_id,
    target_id: target_id,
    type: relation_type,
    weight: weight,
    created_at: current_time()
  }
  
  relationships[relationship_id] ← relationship
  
  // Update indices
  UpdateRelationshipIndices(relationship)
  
  // Handle inverse relationship if defined
  if relation_types[relation_type].inverse:
    inverse_type ← relation_types[relation_type].inverse
    AddRelationship(target_id, inverse_type, source_id, weight)
  
  return {success: true, relationship_id}

Query(start_entity, relation_path, max_depth):
  // Graph traversal query
  if start_entity not in entities: return []
  
  results ← []
  visited ← {start_entity}
  queue ← [{entity: start_entity, depth: 0, path: []}]
  
  while queue is not empty and queue[0].depth < max_depth:
    current ← queue.Dequeue()
    entity_id ← current.entity
    
    // Get related entities
    for each relation_type, targets in outgoing_edges[entity_id]:
      if relation_path is null or relation_type in relation_path:
        for each target_id in targets:
          if target_id not in visited:
            visited.Add(target_id)
            results.append({
              entity_id: target_id,
              path_length: current.depth + 1,
              relation_path: relation_type
            })
            queue.Enqueue({
              entity: target_id,
              depth: current.depth + 1,
              path: current.path + [relation_type]
            })
  
  return results
```

##### 2.13.3.3 Dual-Graph Integration

The Dual-Graph Integration system combines the complementary strengths of vector-based similarity search and structured knowledge representation. It enhances retrieval by leveraging both the Experience Graph's associative pattern matching and the Memory Graph's explicit semantic relationships. When processing a query, the system extracts relevant entities, retrieves related knowledge from both graphs, and combines the results based on relevance to the query. This integrated approach provides more comprehensive and contextually relevant information than either system could deliver independently.

```
Algorithm: EnhancedDualGraphRetrieval

EnhancedDualGraphRetrieval(query_text, top_k):
  query_embedding ← embedding_generator.EmbedText(query_text)
  
  // 1. Get vector database matches
  vector_results ← vector_db.Search(
    query_embedding, top_k, threshold=0.6
  )
  
  // 2. Get experience graph matches
  experience_results ← []
  if HasExperienceGraph():
    experience_results ← experience_graph.RetrieveRelevantMemories(
      query_embedding, top_k, ["abstraction", "cluster", "chunk"]
    )
  
  // 3. Query memory graph with extracted entities
  entities ← ExtractEntities(query_text)
  memory_results ← []
  
  if HasMemoryGraph() and entities:
    for each entity in entities:
      entity_results ← memory_graph.Query(entity, null, 2)
      memory_results.extend(entity_results)
  
  // 4. Combine and rank results
  combined_results ← MergeAndRankResults(
    vector_results,
    experience_results,
    memory_results,
    query_embedding
  )
  
  return First top_k items from combined_results
```

### 2.15 Error Handling & Recovery

The Error Handling & Recovery system provides robust mechanisms for detecting, classifying, and responding to errors throughout the architecture. It implements a comprehensive classification taxonomy, configurable retry policies with exponential backoff, circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures, and context-aware recovery strategies. The system is tightly integrated with the cognitive framework, adjusting its behavior based on the current energy state and deferring non-critical recovery to appropriate sleep cycles. This approach ensures system resilience even under adverse conditions while preserving critical functionality.

```
Algorithm: ErrorHandler

Initialize():
  // Register standard error types
  RegisterErrorType("connection", {
    retryable: true,
    max_retries: 3,
    backoff_factor: 2.0,
    circuit_breaker: true
  })
  
  RegisterErrorType("timeout", {
    retryable: true,
    max_retries: 2,
    backoff_factor: 1.5,
    circuit_breaker: true
  })
  
  RegisterErrorType("resource_not_found", {
    retryable: false,
    log_level: "warning"
  })
  
  // Create circuit breakers
  for each component in application_components:
    circuit_breakers[component.name] ← new CircuitBreaker(
      failure_threshold: 5,
      reset_timeout: 30,
      half_open_requests: 1
    )

HandleError(error, context):
  // Classify error
  error_type ← ClassifyError(error)
  error_config ← error_registry[error_type]
  
  // Track and log error
  IncrementErrorCount(error_type, context.component)
  Log(error_config.log_level, FormatErrorMessage(error, context))
  
  // Handle retryable errors
  if error_config.retryable:
    return HandleRetryableError(error, context, error_config)
  else:
    return HandleNonRetryableError(error, context, error_config)

HandleRetryableError(error, context, config):
  retry_count ← context.retry_count or 0
  
  // Check max retries
  if retry_count ≥ config.max_retries:
    return {success: false, action: "abort"}
  
  // Check circuit breaker
  if config.circuit_breaker:
    circuit ← circuit_breakers[context.component]
    if not circuit.AllowRequest():
      return {success: false, circuit: "open", action: "abort"}
  
  // Calculate backoff delay
  backoff_delay ← config.initial_delay * (config.backoff_factor ^ retry_count)
  
  return {
    success: false,
    retryable: true,
    retry_delay: backoff_delay,
    retry_count: retry_count + 1,
    action: "retry"
  }
```

### 2.16 Security Considerations

#### 2.16.1 Internal Data Security

**Goal:** Protect the confidentiality and integrity of information stored within the system, especially when running locally or on devices like robots.

#### **Part 1: Setting Up Security**

1.  **Start-up:** When the system begins, it needs to prepare its security measures based on its configuration settings.
2.  **Choose Method:** Determine which encryption technique to use (e.g., a standard like AES-GCM).
3.  **Get the Master Key:** Securely load the main secret key. This key is the foundation for all data protection. It might come from a protected file, a system setting, or a special hardware component.
4.  **Log Setup:** Record that the security system has started, but *never* log the actual key.

#### **Part 2: Protecting Data (Encryption)**

1.  **Input:** Receive the data that needs to be protected and an identifier telling us what *kind* of data it is (the context).
2.  **Get Specific Key:** Use the master key and the context identifier to generate or retrieve a specific key *just for this data*. Think of it like using a master key to unlock a box containing a specific key for a particular room.
3.  **Check Key:** If the specific key can't be found or generated, stop and report an error.
4.  **Encrypt:** Use the specific key and the chosen encryption technique to scramble the data. This process also generates tags to ensure the data isn't tampered with later (integrity check).
5.  **Output:** Return the scrambled data along with the necessary information (like the integrity tags) needed to unscramble it later.

#### **Part 3: Accessing Protected Data (Decryption)**

1.  **Input:** Receive the scrambled data package and the context identifier (telling us what kind of data it *should* be).
2.  **Get Specific Key:** Just like in encryption, use the master key and the context identifier to get the *same specific key* that was used to protect this data originally.
3.  **Check Key:** If the specific key isn't available, stop and report an error.
4.  **Decrypt & Verify:** Use the specific key to try and unscramble the data. Crucially, also check the integrity tags to make sure the data hasn't been changed since it was scrambled.
5.  **Check Verification:**
    *   If unscrambling works *and* the integrity check passes, return the original, readable data.
    *   If anything fails (wrong key, data tampered with), report a security alert and return an error indicating failure.

#### **Part 4: Storing Data Securely**

1.  **Input:** Receive data to be stored and a label (storage key) for where to put it.
2.  **Determine Context:** Figure out the context identifier based on the storage label (e.g., is it user preferences, sensor readings?).
3.  **Encrypt:** Use the **Protecting Data (Encryption)** steps (Part 2) to scramble the data using its context.
4.  **Check Encryption:** If encryption failed, stop and report the error.
5.  **Store:** Save the resulting scrambled data package to the designated storage location (e.g., a file). Also, save the context identifier alongside it, so we know which key to use when retrieving it.

#### **Part 5: Retrieving Data Securely**

1.  **Input:** Receive the storage label for the data needed.
2.  **Retrieve:** Fetch the scrambled data package and its associated context identifier from storage using the label.
3.  **Check Retrieval:** If nothing is found at that label, report an error.
4.  **Decrypt:** Use the **Accessing Protected Data (Decryption)** steps (Part 3), providing the retrieved scrambled package and context identifier.
5.  **Output:**
    *   If decryption is successful, return the original, readable data.
    *   If decryption fails, report the error.

#### **Part 6: Managing Keys (Simplified Concept)**

*   **Master Key:** There's a primary secret key. It must be loaded securely when the system starts.
*   **Data Keys:** Specific keys used for actual encryption/decryption are derived from the master key based on the data's context. *Never use the context directly as a key.* Use a secure method to generate a unique key *from* the master key and the context. This ensures different types of data are protected with different (derived) keys, enhancing security.

## 3. Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

This initial phase focuses on establishing the core infrastructure. Key activities include developing the vector operations framework with core similarity algorithms, transformation utilities, batch processing, and normalization functions. Simultaneously, the data storage layer will be created, featuring in-memory vector storage, persistence mechanisms (Parquet/Arrow), schema validation, and metadata support.

Key activities include developing the document processing pipeline with features like normalization, metadata extraction, chunking strategies, language detection, and entity extraction. Concurrently, the web crawling and scraping module will be built, incorporating a crawler framework, robots.txt handling, rate limiting, content extractors, and incremental crawling capabilities. Finally, multimodal processing will be implemented to handle images, audio, PDFs, and tables, ensuring seamless integration of diverse content types.

### 3.4 Phase 4: API and Services

This phase focuses on building the API and service layer. Key activities include implementing the FastAPI service with RESTful endpoints, WebSocket support, authentication middleware, request validation, and response models. Concurrency management will be addressed through thread pooling, asynchronous request handling, rate limiting, request prioritization, and backpressure mechanisms. Finally, service integration involves connecting the service layer to core components, implementing service discovery and health checks, creating API documentation, and developing client libraries.

### 3.5 Phase 5: Optimization & Scaling

This phase focuses on optimizing system performance and ensuring scalability. Key activities include implementing performance enhancements such as caching strategies, database optimizations, parallel and batch processing, and memory management improvements. Concurrently, the scaling architecture will be developed by adding support for horizontal scaling, distributed coordination mechanisms, load balancing, data partitioning strategies, and resilience patterns. Robust monitoring and diagnostics will also be established through telemetry collection, performance dashboards, an alerting system, diagnostic tools, and centralized log aggregation.

### 3.6 Phase 6: Cognitive System Implementation

This phase focuses on implementing the Cognitive System (CRAG). Key tasks include developing the `CognitiveEnergyModel` for energy and entropy tracking, system state transitions, and monitoring. Sleep mechanisms will be implemented, covering sleep stages, scheduling algorithms, maintenance operations, and proactive planning. The dual-graph memory architecture will be constructed, involving the experience graph, memory graph, their integration, and graph-aware retrieval techniques. Finally, the cognitive system will be integrated with the RAG engine and agent framework, API endpoints for cognitive state will be added, and comprehensive testing under various loads will be performed, followed by parameter tuning for optimal performance.

## 4. Testing & Validation

### 4.1 Test Methodology

The system employs a comprehensive test methodology encompassing multiple levels. Unit tests focus on individual components using pytest, mocking dependencies, and aiming for high branch coverage through parameterized and property-based testing. Integration tests validate interactions between components, service layers, databases, and APIs, often mocking external systems. System tests provide end-to-end validation using realistic data scenarios, including performance under load, fault injection, and recovery testing. Finally, specialized tests address crucial non-functional aspects such as security (fuzzing, penetration testing), concurrency, memory leak detection, backward compatibility, and internationalization.

### 4.2 Performance Benchmarks

The system's performance is validated against specific benchmarks, targeting vector search latency under 50ms for 1 million vectors, end-to-end query processing below 200ms, document ingestion under 500ms per document, and individual agent operations completing in less than 1 second. Throughput goals include handling over 100 queries per second, performing over 500 vector searches per second, ingesting more than 50 documents per second, and supporting over 1000 concurrent connections. Resource utilization targets aim for a base memory footprint under 2GB (less than 4GB under load), CPU utilization below 70% at steady state, sustained disk I/O under 100MB/s, and network usage below 50Mbps per instance.

### 4.3 Compliance Validation

Compliance validation ensures the system meets specified standards, including API conformance to OpenAPI specifications, backward compatibility, and adherence to relevant standards. Data handling is validated for integrity, encryption compliance, and proper access control enforcement. Resilience requirements are also tested, confirming the system's ability to recover from failures, degrade gracefully, and maintain data consistency during disruptions.

## 5. Operational Procedures

### 5.1 Deployment Guidelines

Deployment guidelines encompass establishing the necessary environment, detailing hardware recommendations, software dependencies, network configuration, and storage requirements. The installation process provides step-by-step instructions, outlines configuration options, includes validation checks, and specifies rollback procedures. Initial configuration focuses on security setup, performance tuning, defining integration points, and managing initial data loading.

### 5.2 Monitoring & Maintenance

Ongoing operational procedures involve continuous health monitoring, tracking key metrics, analyzing logs, and detecting anomalies against defined alert thresholds. Regular maintenance includes database optimization, cache management, backup execution, and applying updates. Troubleshooting guidelines cover common issues, diagnostic steps, performance tuning, and recovery procedures.

### 5.3 Scaling Considerations

Scaling considerations encompass vertical, horizontal, and database strategies. Vertical scaling involves optimizing memory, CPU, and disk I/O resources within individual instances and managing resource allocation effectively. Horizontal scaling leverages stateless design principles, data partitioning, load balancing, and service discovery to distribute workload across multiple nodes.
